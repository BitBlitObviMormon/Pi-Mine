# Libraries - Game Input / Output Library
&ensp; This is designed to give programs (mostly games) the ability to enter RAW Input Mode which will allow the user to type onto the console without echoing their input onto the console screen. For instance, when using RAW Input Mode, if you press Z, nothing will show up on the screen unless the program wills it to be so. Also, characters can be read without the user pressing enter, allowing the program to be more responsive to user input.
&ensp; This program also features several game functions that may prove useful such as colored output, clearing the screen, and moving the mouse cursor. If your game is buffered (meaning you output a screen-full of text at once) then you may find it faster to move the cursor to 0-0 (the top left corner) and then write your buffer over the screen instead of using the clear screen function; it's quite time consuming.
