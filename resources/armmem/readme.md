# Resources - Arm Memory
&emsp; These programs copy memory from one block to another, one using arm processor instructions and the other using vector processor instructions. If you run <code>time ./arm.out</code> and <code>time ./vfp.out</code> then you'll see whether arm memory accesses or floating point memory accesses are faster for your Raspberry Pi 2. The neat thing about vector memory is that you can do floating point memory accesses while running arm code as long as the arm code does not access memory during that time (Since the floating point processor is a separate entity).
