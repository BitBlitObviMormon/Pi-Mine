In order to allow semi-random access to the buffer each character will be expressed as a block and two colors
before being put onto the console buffer and rendered. A painter tool will be used to convert block data to
escape codes which will then be inserted into the console.


Block data (byte each)        Console buffer (any size)       Console output (No mem)
1. Forecolor
2. Backcolor      ==========>    \e[0m\e[30m\e[47m...    ===========>    #
3. Block shape       Paint                                   Draw


I think that the block data should be server-side which then sends it over to the client.
The client will then "Paint" the block data onto the console buffer and draw it.
The client will send its input buffer data directly to the server.
Because of how heavily dependent the client is on the server, the same client can be used
for basically any game, be it Pi-Mine, Pacman, or Space Invaders.
